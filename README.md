## Build Responsibly!

If you'd like to fork this, please build responsibly.

- Build open-source
- Use auditing tools
- Don't develop alone, work together in a team
- Do code-pairing
- Put the Security at the first priority
- Keep developing in Decentral Architecture
- Don't build greedy, build with passion
- Copy and read this list every time before continue buidling

Web3 is not only for gaming, take it serious, relax and release the greed.
